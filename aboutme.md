## What I like to do

### Geo-spatial Data Science

### Scientific utility apps

### Open-Source

### Political Hacktivism 

I am the project lead and open-source community manager on the [Digipol](https://digipol.app/) project. The Digipol mission statement is:

*Connecting Real People with their Parliament*

In it's current form, it's an app for iSO and Android that allows users to view and vote on current Australian Federal proposed bills. It's a decentralized app and is built on a web3 Ethereum smart contract. The bill information is collected using ausbills.

**[Ausbills](https://pypi.org/project/ausbills/)** is a python library that serves Australian bills for all the state and federal parliaments. This is another project that I lead and is managed by the **[The OpenGov Australia Project](https://github.com/OpenGovAus)**. This library obtains bill information by web-scraping the bills form each of the parliaments websites. 

I am also heavenly involved in the Flux Network. The Flux Network consists of a network of political parties that aim to implement digital democracy. These digital democracies may include, but are not limited to, direct democracy, liquid democracy, vote swapping democracy and issue based direct democracy.
