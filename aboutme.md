## What I like to do

### Geo-spatial Data Science

### Scientific utility apps

### Open-Source

### Political Hacktivism 

I believe that the decisions made on the rules that govern our lives should be accessible, open and participatory. To this end:
- The people MUST have access to existing and upcoming rules (laws)
- Systems and technology that facilitate the decision making process SHOULD be open-source
- The people SHOULD have to opportunity to have their say and vote on existing and upcoming rules

THe following are my efforts toward this:

I am the project lead and open-source community manager on the [Digipol](https://digipol.app/) project. The Digipol mission statement is:

*Connecting Real People with their Parliament*

In it's current form, it's an app for iSO and Android that allows users to view and vote on current Australian Federal proposed bills. It's a decentralized app and is built on a web3 Ethereum smart contract. The bill information is collected using ausbills.

**[Ausbills](https://pypi.org/project/ausbills/)** is a python library that serves Australian bills for all the state and federal parliaments. This is another project that I lead and is managed by the **[The OpenGov Australia Project](https://github.com/OpenGovAus)**. This library obtains bill information by web-scraping the bills form each of the parliaments websites. 

I am also heavenly involved in the Flux Network. The Flux Network consists of a network of political parties that aim to implement digital democracy. These digital democracies may include, but are not limited to, direct democracy, liquid democracy, [vote swapping democracy](https://kipcrossing.github.io/2020-12-29-Vote-Swapping/) and issue based direct democracy.
